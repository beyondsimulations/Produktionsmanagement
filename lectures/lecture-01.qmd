# [Introduction]{.flow} {.title}

## [FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar]{.invert-font} {background-image="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1658490505550-60191ee61ec6?q=80&w=4334&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D" background-size="cover" background-position="center"}

## Public transport

- FIFA Worldcup 2022 took place in a [small region]{.highlight}
- The capacity of the metro system was **finite**
- More than [1 million tourists]{.highlight} where expected
- Metro usage was **free for all ticket holders**
- Transport methods were expected to be **overloaded**

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What could become an issue?**

## [Crowd Disasters]{.invert-font} {background-image="https://images.beyondsimulations.com/ao/ao_metro-crowd.png" background-size="cover" background-position="center"}

::: {.footer}
:::

## Potential locations

[Question:]{.question} **Where could crowd disasters happen?**

. . .

- At event venues and in waiting areas
- At intersections of multiple pedestrian flows
- In narrow passages and entrances
- On crowded metro platforms and transfer stations
- At ticket/turnstile bottlenecks and emergency exits

---

## Metrosystem of Doha

![](images/ao_metro-metro.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Main Bottleneck

[Question:]{.question} **What could be a potential bottleneck?**

. . .

- Red Line has twice the capacity of the Green and Gold Line
- People use the metro to get to the event venues

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What could be the issue?**

- Imagine a match at a stadium along the Gold line
- People from Red and Green line will try to get there
- This will cause a [massive crowd at transfer stations]{.highlight}

## Visualization

![](images/ao_metro-overcrowded.svg){fig-align="center"}

- 10 people want to start per minute at **each station**
- Everybody wants to get to **station D**

## Closer look at the Metro System

![](images/ao_metro-zoom.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Capacities inside the stations

- Capacities **inside the stations** are limited as well
- These include the escalators, stairs, and elevators
- But also the platforms and the ticket gates

. . .

::: {.callout-warning}
This can lead to [overcrowding and potential crowd disasters!]{.highlight}
:::

---

## General Issues

[Question:]{.question} **What could also be an issue?**

. . .

- Often unknown **how many people** exactly will participate
- Gathering data is [extremely importand and difficult]{.highlight}
- Crowd behavior can be [unpredictable and dynamic]{.highlight}
- Weather conditions may affect **transportation preferences**
- Cultural factors influence **crowd movement patterns**
- Emergency situations require **flexible contingency plans**

## {.loud-slide}
::: {.r-fit-text}
Let's take a

closer look at the

problem structure!
:::

::: footer
:::

---

# [Problem Structure]{.flow} {.title}

## Objective

[Question:]{.question} **What could be the objectives of the authorities?**

. . .

- A [safe and successful event]{.highlight} as host country
- Good [publicity and a positive recognition]{.highlight} worldwide
- [Satisfied visitors]{.highlight} that enjoyed their time

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
### Note: We can model none of the above directly!
But we can assist in the estimation of transport demands and the design of operational plans to ensure public **safety** and a **smooth transportation** through the city.
:::

## Underlying Problem

[Question:]{.question} **Can we just start modeling?**

. . .

- First, we need to understand the **movement patterns**
- Event is **unprecedented**, movement patterns are unknown
- Multiple [concurrent events]{.highlight} affect flow patterns

. . .

:::{.callout-tip}
### Tip: We need to estimate the data first!
This is a **huge challenge**, but we can use **simulation** to estimate the data.

:::

---

## Simulation

- Based on [publicly available data]{.highlight} from the area
- Simulates **all individuals** participating at the event
- Includes **all transportation infrastructure**
- [Individual mode choice]{.highlight} based on a choice model

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
### Tip: Julia is a great tool for this!
Simulations was build in Julia. With 1,000,000 individuals walking,using cars, busses, and the metro, a day took **less than 5 minutes**.
:::

## Results of the Simulation

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](https://images.byndsim.com/ao/ao_metro-train_section.png){width=85%}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Detailed movement patterns throughout the region
- Potential sections at risk in the transport infrastructure
- Potential capacity overloads at event locations
:::

## {.loud-slide}
::: {.r-fit-text}
But it is still

based on a lot

of assumptions!

## [Main risk: Metro]{.invert-font} {background-image="https://images.byndsim.com/ao/ao_metro-risk_crowd.png" background-size="cover" background-position="center"}

::: {.footer}
:::

## Idea

[Question:]{.question} **What can we do to prevent crowd disasters?**

. . .

- Regulate the **inflow** at each individual station
- Ensure utilized capacity is [always within bounds]{.highlight}

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What could we try to model?**

. . .

- [Minimize the queues]{.highlight} outside of the metro stations
- Based on the **allowed inflow** and origin-destination data
- Adhering to the **capacity constraints**

## Difficulty

![](images/ao_metro-inflow_impact.svg){fig-align="center"}

. . .

- Movement patterns have different origin-destination pairs
- Regulating the inflow does not affect the destination

---

# [Model Formulation]{.flow} {.title}

## Graph Sets?

[Question:]{.question} **What could be the sets for the graph?**

![](images/ao_metro-overcrowded.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Graph Sets?

- $\mathcal{G}$ - Connected digraph of the metro network $\mathcal{G}=(\mathcal{O},\mathcal{E})$
- $\mathcal{O}$ - Set of metro stations, indexed by $o$
- $\mathcal{E}$ - Set of directed arcs between connected stations

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
### Note: These are the easier sets.
These simply help us to represent the entire metro system as a graph with different nodes $\mathcal{O}$ and arcs $\mathcal{E}$ between connected stations.
:::

## Time Sets?

[Question:]{.question} **What could be the time sets?**

::: {.incremental}
- $\mathcal{T}$ - Set of minutes in the time horizon, indexed by $t$
- $\mathcal{P}$ - Set of periods in the observed time horizon, where $p \in \{1, 2, \dots,n\}$
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
### Note: Number of periods
We further define $n$ as the **number of periods in observed time horizon.**
:::

## Periods

[Question:]{.question} **Why do we add periods here?**

. . .

- Staff needs **clear**, consistent instructions
- Frequent changes in flow [increase risk of errors]{.highlight}
- **Easier** to manage and communicate for planners

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
### Note: Period Length
We define the period length as the length of the period in minutes measured as $m$ minutes, which is the **same for all periods**.
:::

## Mapping Minutes to Periods

- We can define an **additional set** with their relation
- It specifies the relation of [periods $p$ to minutes $t$.]{.highlight}

$$
	I_p =\{t \in \mathcal{T}|(p-1) \times m + 1 \leq t \leq p \times m\} \quad \forall p \in \mathcal{P}
$$

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **Can anybody explain it?**

. . .

- $I_p$ is the set of minutes $t$ that belong to period $p$
- Minutes are **not overlapping**, but they are **continuous**

---

## Parameters?

[Question:]{.question} **What could be possible parameters?**

. . .

- $q_{o,d,p}$ - Demand from station $o$ to $d$ with $o,d \in \mathcal{O}$ in $p$
- $d_{e}$ - Travel time (min) of the arcs $e \in \mathcal{E}$
- $c_e$ - Max. allowed arc entry rate $e$ per minute with $e \in \mathcal{E}$
- $c_{o}^{min}$ - Min. station entry rate $o$ per minute with $o \in \mathcal{O}$
- $c_{o}^{max}$ - Max. station entry rate $o$ per minute with $o \in \mathcal{O}$
- $\alpha$ - Maximal allowed arc utilization ($0 < \alpha < 1$)

---

## Metro Movement

[Question:]{.question} **How do people move inside the metro?**

. . .

- Simple network: assume people use the **shortest path**
- Use [Djikstra's algorithm]{.highlight} to compute it
- From each station to all other stations

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
### Tip: We can save the results in a new set $\mathcal{C}_{o,d}$
This will help us to model the movement inside the metro.
:::

## Shortest Paths (SP)

- $\mathcal{C}_{o,d}$ - Set of arcs $e \in \mathcal{E}$ on the SP from $o,d \in \mathcal{O}$

. . .

:::{.callout-note}
Now we compute the **travel time on the shortest paths.** One parameter for the SP from **station to station** and one for the SP from **station to arc**.
:::
. . .

- $d_{o,d}$ - travel time (min) on SP from $o \in \mathcal{O}$ to $d \in \mathcal{O}$
- $d_{o,e}$ - travel time (min) on SP from $o \in \mathcal{O}$ to $e \in \mathcal{E}$

## People Spreading

[Question:]{.question} **How do people spread?**

![](images/ao_metro-inflow_impact.svg){fig-align="center"}


## Ratio of Origin-Destination

- We **cannot control** the destination of the passengers
- Thus we assume that people spread [based on destination]{.highlight}

. . .

$$\frac{q_{o,d,p}}{\sum_{d \in \mathcal{O}} q_{o,d,p}} \quad \forall o,d \in \mathcal{O}, p\in \mathcal{P}$$

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
Based on the ratio of the different destinations $d$ to the total queue for each station $o \in \mathcal{O}$ in each period $p \in \mathcal{P}$.
:::

---

# [Variables and Objective]{.flow} {.title}

## Decision Variable?

::: {.callout-important}
## Our goal is to:
Regulate the **inflow** at **each individual station** to **minimize the queues** outside the metro stations based on the allowed inflow while **adhering to the capacity constraints.**
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
There is **one queue for all passenger flow directions**, as managing multiple queues would be too complex for the planners!
:::

## Decision Variable

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following sets:

- All the metro stations, $o \in \mathcal{O}$
- All periods under observation, $p \in \mathcal{P}$
:::

[Question:]{.question} **What could be our decision variable?**

. . .

- $X_{o,p}$ - Allowed inflow (per minute) at station $o$ in period $p$

---

## Objective Function?

::: {.callout-important}
## Our main objective is to:

Regulate the **inflow** at **each individual station** to **minimize the queues** outside the metro stations based on the allowed inflow while **adhering to the capacity constraints.**
:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **How again are queues minimized?**

. . .

- By the allowed inflow $X_{o,p}$ subtracted from the queue

## Objective Function

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following parameters and variables:

- $q_{o,d,p}$ - People queued to travel from station $o$ to $d$ with $o,d \in \mathcal{O}$ in period $p$
- $X_{o,p}$ - Allowed inflow (per minute) at station $o$ in period $p$

:::

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **What could be our objective function?**

. . .

$$
\text{minimize} \quad \sum_{o \in \mathcal{O}} \sum_{p \in \mathcal{P}} (\sum_{d \in \mathcal{O}} q_{o,d,p} - m \times X_{o,p})
$$

---

# [Constraints]{.flow} {.title}

## Necessary Constraints

[Question:]{.question} **What constraints do we need?**

![](images/ao_metro-overcrowded.svg){fig-align="center" width=80%}

. . .

- The capacity of each arc is **not exceeded**
- Do not dispatch more people than are queued
- Do not dispatch less than the minimum allowed inflow



## {.loud-slide}
::: {.r-fit-text}
Things are going to

get a little

complicated now!
:::

::: footer
:::

---

## Central Question

[Question:]{.question} **When do people flowing into the metro system change the arcs?**

. . .

- People enter metro station at $o$ with destination $d$
- They will lead to a usage of an arc $e$ on their SP
- This usage depends on their path and the travel times

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
### Tip: You'll likely know what we need now!
We can add a new set $\mathcal{R}_{e,t}$ to help us with this.
:::

## Set of Time-Delays

$$
\mathcal{R}_{e,t} = \{(o,d,p) \mid
    \begin{array}{l}
    (o,d) | o,d \in \mathcal{O}, \\
    q_{o,d,p} > 0, \\
    e \in \mathcal{C}_{o,d}, \\
    t-d_{o,e} \in I_p, \\
    p \in \mathcal{P}\}
    \end{array}
    \quad \forall e \in \mathcal{E}, t \in \mathcal{T}
$$

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **Who can explain this set?**

. . .

The set $\mathcal{R}_{e,t}$ contains **all combinations** $(o,d,p)$ which trigger a **capacity utilization** of arc $e$ in period $t$.

## Small Example

![](images/ao_metro-set_r.svg){fig-align="center"}

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
The set contains all possible o-d pairs and periods, that result in passengers starting at arc $(C,D)$ at minute $22$. For m=2, it would be:

$\{((A,D),3),((B,D),5),((C,D),11),((E,D),9)\}$.

:::

## {.loud-slide}
::: {.r-fit-text}
Essentially, we can use this

set to compute the utilization

of an arc at each minute based

on the inflow level at the

different stations and periods.
:::

::: footer
:::

---

## Ensure Capacity Utilization?

::: {.callout-important}
## The goal of this constraint is to:
Ensure that the capacity of each arc is not exceeded at any minute.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following variable, parameter and set:

- $q_{o,d,p}$ - people waiting to travel from station $o \in \mathcal{O}$ to station $d \in \mathcal{O}$ in $p$
- $c_e$ - people max. allowed to enter arc $e$ per minute with $e \in \mathcal{E}$
- $\mathcal{R}_{e,t}$ - mapping of station entries to arc $e$ in time $t$ with $e \in \mathcal{E}$ and $t \in \mathcal{T}$
- $\alpha$ - maximal allowed arc utilization ($0 < \alpha < 1$)
- $X_{o,p}$ - the allowed inflow per minute at metro station $o$ in the period $p$
:::

## Ensure Capacity Utilization

[Question:]{.question} **What could be the constraint?**

. . .

$$
\sum_{(o,d,p) \in \mathcal{R}_{e,t}} X_{o,p} \times \frac{q_{o,d,p}}{\sum_{f \in \mathcal{O}} q_{o,f,p}} \leq \alpha \times c_{e} \quad \forall e \in \mathcal{E}, t \in \mathcal{T}
$$

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
Here, we combine the inflow at each station based on the o-d proportion and let the people spread through the network, checking that no arc is over-utilized at any minute.
:::

---

## Dispatch Only Available People?

::: {.callout-important}
## The goal of this constraint is to:
Ensure that we do not dispatch more people than are queued and less than the minimum allowed inflow, preventing over- and under-dispatching.
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## We need the following variables and parameters:

- $X_{o,p}$ - Allowed inflow (per minute) at station $o$ in period $p$
- $q_{o,d,p}$ - People queued to travel from station $o$ to $d$ with $o,d \in \mathcal{O}$ in $p$
- $m$ - period length in minutes

:::

## Dispatch Only Available People

[Question:]{.question} **What could be the constraint?**

. . .

::: {.temp-math-size}
```{=html}
<style>
.temp-math-size .math.display .MathJax  {
  font-size: 85% !important;
}
</style>
```

$$
\min\{\frac{\sum_{d \in \mathcal{O}} q_{o,d,p}}{m},c_{o}^{\min}\} \leq X_{o,p} \leq \min\{\frac{\sum_{d \in \mathcal{O}} q_{o,d,p}}{m},c_{o}^{\max}\} \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}, p \in \mathcal{P}
$$
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
We need this constraint for **two reasons**:

1. We could also dispatch more people than there are as this would **minimize the objective value. **
2. We also need to ensure that we can dispatch at **least the minimum allowed inflow** or less if the queue is smaller than the minimum allowed inflow.

## [Metro Inflow Optimization]{.invert-font} {background-image="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1658490505550-60191ee61ec6?q=80&w=4334&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D" background-size="cover" background-position="center"}

. . .

[[Question:]{.question} **Can this be applied?**]{.invert-font}

::: {.footer}
:::

## Metro Inflow Problem

- Solved very fast [within seconds]{.highlight} for realistic problem sizes
- **But** we cannot plan or control the metro inflow
- Queues are **too simplified** with passengers disappearing

. . .

[Question:]{.question} **Any ideas, how the current model could be improved or how it could be embedded into a heuristic?**

## Heuristic: Step-Wise Optimization

- Solve the model for the time-horizon of a **few periods**
- Fix the inflow in the **current first period**
- Decrease capacity in the network **based on the inflow**
- Transfer **remaining queues** into the subsequent period
- [Solve the model again]{.highlight}
- **Repeat**, until the inflow is computed for all periods

## Transport Demand

![](images/ao_metro-transportdemand.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Utilization Analysis

![](images/ao_metro-arcutil.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Implementation

- **Assumption of known destinations** based is strong
- Movements **seemed to follow our forecasts**
- We did achieve our goal of **metro inflow control**
- Simulation was used to **estimate the inflows**

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
Few dangerous situations, especially at the FIFA Fan Fest, were **handled well** by the authorities.
:::

## Wrap Up

- Model can help to achieve a [good balance]{.highlight}
- Can be adapted easily to **any metro system worldwide **
- Especially interesting for **larger Asian cities**

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
## And that's it for todays lecture!

We now have covered a metro inflow control problem based on a real-world application and are ready to start solving some new tasks in the upcoming tutorial.
