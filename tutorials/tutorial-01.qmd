# Introduction

Consider the depicted 'Golden Line' on the left with 4 different stations A, B, C, D. For an upcoming timeframe of **10 minutes divided into 10 periods**, the transportation demand is going to exceed the available capacity of the network and each origin-destination pair will be requested by at least 1 passenger. **To handle the inflow, queues will be put in place at each metro station.**

# The Challenge

Your task is to **minimize the queues** without exceeding the available transport capacity of **max. 100 passengers per minute of each arc**. A safety buffer per arc is not needed. Each station layout is excellent, with sufficient stairs and escalators. Thus, the station itself is fully capable of handling any inflow that may result from the optimized restricted inflow. Nonetheless, queues are still necessary as the arcs cannot handle each input.

# 1. Flow Analysis

Suppose we are in minute 7 at the arc of (D,A). Which inflows from which stations are going to impact the flow into the arc in this minute?

Write out the set $\mathcal{R}_{(D,A),7}$ and **shortly explain** your answer. You can write out the set in a comment, for example like this:

```julia
#=
{(A,B,1), (B,C,1), (C,D,1)}
=#
```

To solve this task, it might be helpful to work with paper and pen to sketch the problem.

::::

As there is a rather large fluctuation of allowed inflow between periods, you are asked to introduce new constraints for the model. In the first period, the inflow at each station is supposed to be unrestricted. Thereafter, it is maximally allowed to change by 20 persons in both directions per period at each station.

Can you write out the decision variables and the additional constraints for the model as JuMP constraints?

::: {.callout-tip}
You don't need to solve the model or define the objective function. You just need to constraint the fluctuations and add the appropriate variables.

# 3. Bidirectional Flow

![Bidirectional Metro Network](images/ao_metro-metro_tutorial_bidirect.svg)

The metro was improved and there is now the possibility to travel in both directions. How would this change the set $\mathcal{R}_{(MD,MA),7}$ from 1.?

Write out the new set $\mathcal{R}_{(D,A),7}$ manually and shortly explain your answer.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solutions"}
```{julia}
#=
# YOUR ANSWER BELOW
{
    (C, A, 6),
    (D, A, 7)
}
In case we acknowledge, that the travel time on some paths is identical, we can also include more entries such as (B,A,4).

# 4. Capacity Analysis

Although the system is two-directional now, the **overall number of trains of the metro provider has not changed**. Would the change from a one-directional metro system to a two-directional metro system decrease the likelihood of crowd-accidents due to insufficient arc-capacities?

Please explain your answer in a few sentences.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solutions"}
```{julia}
#=
# YOUR ANSWER BELOW
That does really depend on the actual demand for the different OD-pairs. Depending on the demand we can find cases where the two-directional flow is better and cases where the one-directional flow is better.

# 5. Computing the Set $\mathcal{R}_{e,t}$

Can you compute the set $\mathcal{R}_{e,t}$ for the one-directional flow? Generate a dictionary $R$ that contains $e \times t$ entries. Each entry $r_{e,t}$ should contain a vector with all origin-destination pairs and the corresponding time period saved as a tuple. Use the results to check your answer from the first task.

::: {.callout-note}
This task can be a bit tricky, as it is a bit of a challenge. But as it is the last tutorial, I figured a small challenge is fine.
